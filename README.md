# Experiments based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for tall data
### Matthieu Sommervogel and Marine Robinson

This is our experiments for the paper On Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for tall data from R. Bardenet, A. Doucet and C. Holmes. The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02827

To run the code you must download all the files, and just run the cells of the notebook. 
The data is taken from https://donneespubliques.meteofrance.fr/?fond=produit&id_produit=90&id_rubrique=32.
